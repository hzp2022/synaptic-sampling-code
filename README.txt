    Details to the Code:

    This folder contains the source code that was used to create the
    experimental results reported in [1] and some examples how to
    use it.

    The experiments were run in Matlab R2007a (7.4.0.287)
    on a 64-bit Linux machine (Fedora, Core release 6 (Zod))
    and Matlab R2011b (7.13.0.564) on a 64-bit Linux machine
    (Debian 4.8.4-1 (Jessie)).

    To get started run the main.m script (you need writing permission
    on the current working directory).

    This will perform a number of different training sessions and plot
    the results. The results are saved to the results/ subfolder of
    your current working directory.
